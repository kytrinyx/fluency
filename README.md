# Fluency (In Programming Languages)

This experiments with turning Exercism exercises into repositories that can be used
as assignments in GitHub Classroom, allowing students to use git and GitHub as the interface,
rather than the Exercism command-line client and website.

The scripts assume that the track repositories are checked out parallel to this repository:

```
.
├── fluency/
│   ├── LICENSE
│   ├── ...
│   └── repos
└── tracks/
    ├── xbash
    ├── xcpp
    ├── ...
    └── xvbnet
```
